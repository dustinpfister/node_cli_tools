# nc-edit

The node-cli-tools project text editor example.

When it comes to making a text editor for nodejs there is making a terminal based editor, and then there is making a project that involves a client system, and a back end that can be used to create and edit files. For this project I will be making the later where text is edited in a browser window and then sent to a back end system using http requests which is then saved to a file system. The reason why is that this is more likely the kind of text editor that I would actually use, rather than a terminal based approach. Still I might make an editor like that, it is just that is a matter for another project.
