title: First post for a Node Cli Tools powered website.
---

This is a demo post for a new website that was created using my [node_cli_tools](https://github.com/dustinpfister/node_cli_tools) project. This post should be deleted, or at least edited depending on the nature of the website you wish to start.

## The _posts folder

The posts folder of this project folder is where markdown files are stored. If nc-hexer hex obfustication is being used, you will want to use the nc-edit command to start editing posts in that folder to help with the process of converting the hexed content into plain human readable text. In any case it is the editor that is designed to be used with these projects.

Just make the root of the project folder the current working directory in a terminal window, and use the nc-edit command. Or use the target option to set the path, and set a port if needed the default should be 8080.
```
$ cd to-project-folder-root
$ nc-edit -t ./ -p 8080
```

Once that is up and running go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to start using nc-edit to edit posts.
